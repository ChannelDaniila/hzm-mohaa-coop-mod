This particular modification is developed on and meant to be run with [Medal of Honor: Allied Assault War Chest (GOG Edition)](https://www.gog.com/game/medal_of_honor_allied_assault_war_chest]) and it's fixes, but there are reports that it runs fine on free, [Revival](http://mymoh.tk/) version of game.

Needs to be packed in zzzzzz_co-op_hzm_mod_mohaa.pk3 and put into maintt
